## Features
- ‚úÖ Real-time speech transcription
- ‚úÖ Manual text editing and clearing
- ‚è≥ Copy transcribed text to clipboard (coming soon)
- üñ•Ô∏è Modern, responsive user interface

## How It Works

This application uses the browser's built-in **Web Speech API** (`SpeechRecognition`) for its core functionality. All audio processing is handled directly in the browser, making it fast and private.

The application state and API logic are managed by a custom React Hook (`useSpeechRecognition`), which keeps the UI components clean and focused on presentation.

## Tech Stack
- **Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Testing:** Vitest & React Testing Library
- **Styling:** CSS Modules

## Browser Compatibility
The Web Speech API is currently a non-standard technology. As such, this application is only fully functional in **Chromium-based browsers**:
- ‚úÖ Google Chrome
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Edge
- ‚ùå Mozilla Firefox (Not Supported)
- ‚ùå Apple Safari (Not Supported)

A future update will include a cloud-based fallback to support all browsers.
